# Leadership Principles

# Introduction

- Born in Russia, graduated high school
- I knew that I wanted more from the world, I wanted to explore and experience it.
- So I travelled to the USA, where I got accepted to the USA university for a B.sc. in Comp Science.
- Back at that time I knew that I wanted to do data science. It wasn't as popular as it is know, but I already knew that there is something about data science, data analysis and AI that I love.
- You might ask what is it, but, to be honest, I cannot really say: **just analyzing the data and making decisions based on it** is something that I find as a very **concrete approach**. From that you might also think that **I like mathematics**, and you would be right.
- So, I graduated with summa cum laude and got accepted into the University of Luxembourg for an M.Sc. in Data Science.
- A lot of people asked me why, why would I leave USA and go to Luxembourg, but again, its new experience and I believe experince is something very important in the world. Besides, I thought that I would like EU more than USA, its just personal.
- So, here I am, I have been studying in the Uni of Luxembourg for the past 1.5 years.
- During my studies, I have worked as a Research Assistant at a VR Lab, developing educational VR applications and supporting research in machine learning and VR.
- As I am now in my final semester, I need to either write a thesis or do an internship to graduate. And I chose the second option.
- and this is why I applied for this internship. I believe it offers the perfect opportunity for me and for you: I believe that all the skills and knowledge that I've gained throughout my education and work, all my passion applies for this position, for the company, offered by you. And I truly believe its benefitical for both of me, team I will work with and essentially Amazon.

- **Leadership/Initiative**
- **Resilience**
- **Teamwork**
- **Influencing/Persuasion**
- **Ethical/Moral**
- **Now, what I've learned from this whole story/experience, is that it's important to**:
  - back your opinions with examples, drafts, data when presenting your argument.
  - take initiative, be resilient, understand teammwork, establishing clear working pipeline for a succesful project.
  - understand everybody's viewpoint, in order to successfully work in a team.

Remember the situation when I sent a wrong video card to a customer. I was in a managerial position, I was responsible for ensuring correct packaging and shipping to maintain high customer satisfaction. The business lived on high customer satisfaction. If its not us, then another supplier. Well, one time I accidentally sent the wrong video card to a customer. That might sound like not a big deal, but for me it was, usually my mistakes were minor, so I didn't know how to properly handle it. So I though: I am screwed. But I understood that there was only 1 way to fix this: tell my boss about it. I informed my boss rather than trying to fix it silently as I usually did with my or my team minor mistakes. But, you might already guessed that in the end there was nothing to be afraid of. We spoke about it, understood that the part I sent was actually better than the one that the customer ordered, so it was somewhat fine. We reached out to the customer, explained the error, offered to send the correct part right away, and covered the return shipping of the incorrect part. In the end, the customer was satisfied and didn't experience any major disturbances and I built more trust with my boss. So, what I learned from this whole experience:
   - The sooner I communicate a mistake, the easier (and less costly) it is to fix.
   - Admitting I made an error can actually build trust when handled properly.
   - Taking responsibility, moving quickly to correct the issue, and keeping everyone informed is important.

1. **Customer Obsession**:  make decisions and take actions that make sure customers are prioritized. 
   1. During my work in VR lab, I had to create a VR educational application for kids and adults that teaches eye tracking technology. After trials, I asked users to report their experience and what went wrong, what needs to be improved. In the end, the demo review was good. I always strive to make the final product perfect, ofcourse taking into account resources. 
   2. During my work in US, I increased the bar for the quality of items that were shipped, for the quality of packaging (new boxes, new labels with company logo on it, additional supplies with items (power cables)). For me it wasn't hard to understand what customers wanted, and usually this was just **honesty**.
2. **Ownership**: taking responsibility for any issues that you come across, thinking of solutions. 
   1. Tough decision during a project: 
      - Situation: I was working in a VR lab, tasked with developing an application to teach eye-tracking principles. The deadline was near, and there was a disagreement between your boss’s vision (Space Invaders–style level) and your own idea (LiDAR-like maze).
      - Task: Deliver a functioning VR level that effectively teaches eye-tracking concepts. You only had time to create one fully polished level, so you had to decide how to proceed despite conflicting ideas.
      - Action: Instead of picking one idea arbitrarily, I took the initiative to create rough prototypes for each. I then scheduled a follow-up meeting with your boss to showcase both prototypes, explaining the trade-offs in terms of learning objectives and feasibility within the time constraints. I cared about best educational and engaging experience for users.
      - Result: In the end, boss agreed that your maze concept was more innovative and effective. The reviews for this particular level after the demo from the uses were also the highest.
3. **Invent and Simplify**: implementing smart and easy solutions.
   1. **How you solved a complex problem?**
      1. I usually solved complex problems by first divising a plan and braking everything into simples managebale pieces. For example, I am currently working on a final project for one of the clases in the uni. I am in a team of 3 people. The final project consists for 4 tasks: 2 theory and 2 programming tasks, one of them is simple, the other is much difficult. I took the initiative in a team and decided to assign roles, created a github repo, a google slides presentation for the team. Then, after the meeting, we distributed tasks and I volunteered for the hardest programming task. The task was to train a segmentation neural network to detect brain tumors in MRI images. Then, I broke down my tasks again into smaller tasks to keep everything neat and tidy. I communicate with team regularly to update on my progress. Now, everything is ready, we scheduled a meeting to finalize our report, presentation and discuss the code.
   2. **How do you handle obstacles?**
      1. I usually treat obstacles as something natural, that always occurs. I don't even think about them as obstacles. Mention maybe the paper and the wrong algorithm. Ok, the algorithm was wrong, so instead of doing nothing, I just said what is wrong and how it can be solved. I proposed my solution, the algorithm in the end worked with my solution.
4. **Are Right, A Lot**: having the confidence and good judgement to know when you're right and when you're wrong.
   1. Decision without data: For imagingAI, sample dataset to start working early. Make drafts, pipeline.
   2. Convince teammembers on something that I proposed: either EDA model or advanced ML paper. We would make a vote between me and my teammate, but in the end the paper of my choice won. I persuaded my teammate.
5. **Learn and Be Curious**: kicking the tires, poking around, and trying to understand things.
   1. Skill recently learned: rock climbing, how to take care of plants, latest YOLOv11 model, how diffussion models work, graph databases, Unity VR development, meditating.
6. **Hire and Develop the Best**: how you coach, mentor and develop your peers, making sure that you are sharing knowledge.
   1. How did you resolve a conflict? The only "big" conflict I remember was during my work in US during COVID times. I was sick and one of the people who I managed was very scared of the whole COVID situation. They were wearing masks the whole time, even though we all were in the same office for 8 hours straight, and she made a big deal of my sickness. I said it was not covid, I knew it wasn't, some other disease, the symptomps were like from a common flu. But she insisted that I go into home for a week into a quarantine. So, it was either give her a paid week off, or don't come to work for a week myself, which was impossible, I was basically representative of the company at that time and boss spoke through me to other employees.
7. **Insist on the Highest Standards**: standards we hold are high, and we continue to keep them high. 
   1. That's the principle I use when I write code. My code is always documented, tested, and the results are reproducible. When I work in a team, I always make sure that other people understand my work.
8. **Think Big**: thinking outside of the box.
9.  **Bias For Action**: looking at a problem, weighing up the risks and benefits, figuring out a solution fast and then just doing it. I always have a feeling: if it's not me, then who. If I don't jump into action, then I'm losing valuable experience.
10. **Frugality**: doing the most you can with what you've got and challenging yourself to do more with less.
    1.  For EDA project, one person requisted to join our group. I knew that we could complete it with just 2 of us and adding a third person would create an overhead. It's either he is not doing anything and still gets credit, which is unfair to our and other teams, or he is not joining. Also the person was not dependable. The task for very sequential, so giving him either the hardest last part or some of the simpler first parts, I just wasn't too sure about that.
11. **Earn Trust**: all about over communication and honesty, while still being very frank and quick (for example, if your customer feedback doesn’t match your numbers, then you would probably go with your customer feedback over the statistics). 
12. **Dive Deep**: quantitative and qualitative: picking through the layers to get to the root cause of a problem, staying connected to the data and then forming an opinion.
    1.  **"Five whys"**: work through a problem by asking "why" until we arrive at the true root cause of something.
13. **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**: standing up for an idea using data rather than your opinion. 
    1.  **How do you manage difficult conversations?** I prepare for them, for example how I prepared for this interview, or how I preprare for projects presentations or demos at work. In terms of conflict, remember the situation with 2 levels. I ask they hear my opinion (if I am involved), hear their opinion, develop both and see what's in the end better and promising. That's like with ML model training: you don't know which hyperparameters are the best. You try them out, and pick only the promising options.
14. **Deliver Results**: overcoming obstacles, and the work you do to overcome them and deliver. Maybe instead of mentioning when you delivered results, mention when you didn't deliver. Mention Complex Network homework, which would require you to review the whole repository to understand what needs to be done for the model to work.
    1.  **How do you prioritize?** From experience or try drafting to understand the problem deeper.
    2.  **Challenging project**: bachelors final project? Challenging because the team was too big. So I decided to split the roles. I took what I wanted and asked if anyone wants to do it too. If not, then choose other roles. I created a github repo. Other people who were assigned created reports, presentation slides. I was basically full stack developer there, more on backend side. I created a discord server, different channels divided into separate tasks, scheduled weekly meetings. It was hard, I believe we had 7 people in our group working on 1 project in short amount of time.
15. **Strive to be Earth's Best Employer**: trive every day to build a safer, more productive, more diverse and just working environment.
16. **Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility**: consider the impact on local communities, our planet and future generations; leaders should create more than they consume, and always work to leave things better than how they found them.
    1.  **Describe a time your project failed**. Deep learning project, stock market forecasting using Transformer model. It failed, no good results compared to very simple baseline model. However, it was still great experience and I learned a lot from it. Everything is documented, I gave my theories on why it failed and what could improve the results.

- Mention **responsibility**, how I always strive to take the role of a **leader** in the group. I always have a feeling, if it's not me, then who. If I don't jump into action, then I'm losing valuable experience.
- At work in US, I knew that everything that my group sends to customers is my responsibility. All the tests, packaging, items that were send - even if I was not directly involved in the process - I am responsible.
- I always take the **initiative**. This is especially true during my master's studies. I start projects first and early, plan out the whole project, understand the issues and whats needs to be done and what shouldn't be done. Then, I distribute the tasks among the group members and usually I either take the hardest task, if the work can be done in parallel, or the one that starts the motion of the project, if its sequential.
- Right now I working on 2 projects for my university, both in teams of 3 people. For both of the projects I took the initiative and created the repository, group chat, code outline, report outline, etc. One of the projects is sequantial, one task depends on the other. I started the project and once I was finished with my part, I documented everything and made sure to make it as easy as possible to continue working on the next task. Another project is parallel. There, 3 of the 4 tasks are related to basic computer vision, last task is related to building a whole training and testing pipeline for a deep learning model. I took the last task, again creating the server where we can discuss everything, created a github repo so that we can share our work, created a presentation file and of couse finished my task. Once thing that I would **improve** in my approach is directly ask people on their progress and what has been done from their part, so that I can understand the progress of our work, read details on their work (we present the project together) and adjust my schedule accordingly.

# About Myself

- I am a reliable, responsible person who likes to take initiative and always committed to delivering best results. I am attentive, curious and detail-driven. I am a kind person, open and can listen. I believe being consistent and always moving forward is the key. I am not afraid of new possibilities, ideas, I like to explore.
- I might strive for perfection, which is not always good. I like to stay quiet during social interactions, I like to listen to other people and their opinions and think first before I say something.

# SQL Projects

1. IMBD Database (tsv files). Use PostgreSQL, create a database, tables accroding to a given schema, copy data from tsv files. Define primary, foreign keys and implement analytical queries: most populat directors, top 25 actors that occur in the same movies, frequent 2-itemsets and 3-itemsets of actors or directors (a-priori algorithms).
2. Big data challenge: create a large data file, aggregate data and find median, and perform runtime analysis. Second part is to use Apache Hadoop and MapReduce: perform word counting.
3. Perform inverted indexing (process of mapping each word (key) to a list of documents (values) in which it appears) and query processing in MapReduce in Hadoop. Using MapReduce, perform analytical queries from project 1. Use Apache Pig to perform those analytical queries.
4. Perform analytical queries in Apache Hive. Create clustered tables which contain sorted data buckets in Hive and perform a bucketized Map-size join to join two tables based on a common id column. Lastly, perform Memory-backed join using Hadoop and HBase.
