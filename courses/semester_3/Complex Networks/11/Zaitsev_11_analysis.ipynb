    "Please note that this notebook file does not contain any results or code. I tried to run the code provided in the Graph ViT/MLP_Mixer repository (https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/Graph-ViT-MLPMixer), but I persistently faced errors that required fixing. Eventually, I decided to stop trying.\n",

    "Additionally, if I were to use the model on the Facebook graph for the link prediction task, as we did in previous exercises, it would take quite some time to review the repository code and understand how to properly preprocess the Facebook data into a format compatible with the model. While I believe Graph ViT/MLP_Mixer is a great advancement in the graph machine learning research, I also think there is no point for me now spending a lot of time on it. \n",
