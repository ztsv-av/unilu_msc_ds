    "Adjacency matrix provides a straightforward way to represent the connections in a network. With the adjacency matrix of a given graph we can reconstruct the original graph, since we have a direct access to the edges of the graph (there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ if $A[i,j] \\neq 0$, with $A$ - adjacency matrix). Besides, we can use adjacency matrix to perform matrix operations to analyze the graph, e.g. find shortest path between nodes, perform clustering or to find isolated nodes, i.e. tell if the graph is connected or not. Generally, if the network is not big, adjacency matrix is a efficient way to perform matrix-based calculations to analyze networks."
