    "**(c)** Implement Greedy IM: Influence Maximization is the problem that lies in the heart of influence analysis and addresses how to find a set of nodes, such that if they start a diffusion, the number of infected nodes in the network (influenced spread) will be maximized. It has a broad range of applications, from viral marketing, which was the initial motivation for the problem, to epidemiological containment and political campaign management.\n",
    "The problem can be formulated as follows: given a social network, a diffusion model with some parameters and a number k, find a seed set S $\\subset$ V of size k such that the influence spread is maximized.  We will use the well known method from Kempe et al.[ [1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/956750.956769?casa_token=tkl-2BIJoXIAAAAA:SD8O7LcvEPGyGAdv8cHEwSqgn3Jz0UeHvpRK3-xYB2Z9C7gy-iOQpeHoFqOWzDMfAskBgVzYrpzS)] that is based on the fact that the function of the influence spread under the IC and LT models is monotone non-decreasing and submodular, which gives a  $(1-1/e)$ approximation ratio to the optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify and speed up the implementation to less then a minute, we are going to use only one simple simulation based on the function defined above. Moreover, we will reduce the search space of the algorithm by giving as an input a set of selected nodes to search on. To find a shorter set of such nodes, you can use the filter\\_graph function below, that removes nodes under a certain degree, and set an appropriate threshold e.g. 3. We utilize these shortcuts because we need to make the algorithm run in time for the lab. You are encouraged to experiment further in your own time with an implementation that matches more the original algorithm, mainly in order to get a firm understanding of the computational demand of influence maximization."
