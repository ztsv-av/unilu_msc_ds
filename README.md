# University of Luxembourg – Master of Science in Data Science Coursework and Thesis

This repository contains my academic work from the Master of Science in Data Science program at the University of Luxembourg.

The repository includes coursework, assignments, projects, practical exercises, and thesis-related materials completed throughout the program. All content is organized by semester and topic.

The purpose of making this repository public is transparency and knowledge sharing. It documents my academic progression and applied work in data science, statistics, machine learning, etc.

## Content Overview

Academic materials are organized under the `courses/` directory and grouped by semester.
